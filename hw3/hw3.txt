HW #3

1.
a. String of 0's follow by string of 1's with equal number of 1's and 0's
b. String begin with '+' or '-', with arbitrary number of '0', '1', 'a', and end with 'aa'
c. String of arbitrary equally balanced parentheses.
d. String of arbitrary 'a' and 'b', but number of 'a' equals to number of 'b'
e.



2. 
a. It is First/First conflict.
unambiguous grammar: S -> 0 S 1 | epsilon

b. It is LL(1) it is aambiguous.

c. It is First/Follow conflict.
unambiguous grammar: S -> "(" S ")" | epsilon


d. It is First/Follow conflict
unambiguous grammar: S -> a b S | b a S | epsilon


3.
Transfer 1d to following
(1) S -> a S b S
(2) S -> b S a S
(3) epsilon

1st Leftmost Derivation: S =1=> a S b S =3=> a b S =1=> a b a S b S =3=> a b a b S =3=> a b a b
Corresponding parse tree:
       S           
    / / \ \
   a  S  b  S
      |    //\ \
          a S b S
            |   |

Rightmost derivation for the same parse tree:
        S           
    / /  \ \
   a  S   b S
    //\\    |
   a S b S
     |   |

2rd Leftmost Derivation: S =1=> a S b S =2=> a b S a S b S =3=> a b a S b S =3=> a b a b S =3=> a b a b
Corresponding parse tree:
        S           
    / /  \ \
   a  S   b S
    //\\    |
   a S b S
     |   |

Rightmost derivation for the same parse tree:
       S           
    / / \ \
   a  S  b  S
      |    //\ \
          a S b S
