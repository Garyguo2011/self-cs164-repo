Object sampleOject = new Integer(1);
String sampleString = (String) sampleObject;
System.out.println(sampleString);
// This will output ClassCastException

3.
flag = "static"
def foo():
	buffer = flag
	return buffer

def bar():
	flag = "dynamic"
	return foo()

print (bar())

# In Static scoping:
# Program above will print "static"

# In Dynamic scoping:
# Program above will print "dynamic"

(1) def Y f = f (Y f)
(2) def g h x = if x = 0 then 1 else h(x-1) * x fi
(3) def fact x = Y g x

From (2), According to "if x = 0", we know type of x if integer. According to "then 1" we can get the return type for this function is Integer. So the type of "g" is "int -> int".

From (3), According to "Y g x", we know "g" is "int -> int", which is Y's input. So the input of Y will be "int -> int". 

From (1), we see the function "f" is recursive call itself, then it return type will be the same as the input type. to the Y output will be "int -> int". Therefore Y's type will "int -> int -> int -> int".

From (3), since "int -> int" is "Y g" output type. then "x" will be input as int, and final return type will int. As conclude, the type of "fact" will be "int -> int"

Y: int -> int -> int -> int
g: int -> int
fact: int -> int
